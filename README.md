Introduction 

In the first part of this report, we'll introduce the HV Safety Box, which was designed to keep operators safe during use. We  started by checking how the safety box works.
In the second part, we focused on the flyback converter's operation. We have measured its efficiency, how well it regulates power, and examine its startup process. All these tests are done inside the safety box to ensure everyone's safety.

Figure 2:  A simple flyback schematic 

The flyback converter efficiently converts DC voltage by storing and releasing energy through a transformer, offering precise voltage regulation by controlling the switching transistor's duty cycle. It's cost-effective, versatile, and widely used in various electronic devices.
